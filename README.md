# Hi there, I’m **Ronit Kumar** (aka **Ronitk1642**)

I’m a passionate developer and lifelong learner embarking on an exciting journey through code. I recently joined GitHub (joined on **August 7, 2025**) and am excited to build, collaborate, and grow here. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

##  What I’m About

- **Exploring** foundational topics like data structures, algorithms, and software architecture.
- **Learning** languages such as **Java**, **Python**, **C++**, and brushing up on **web development** with **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**.
- **Experimenting** with personal coding projects — even without public repositories visible yet, every project helps me grow. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

##  Goals

- **Populate this profile** with meaningful projects and open-source contributions.
- **Collaborate** with fellow developers on cool and challenging ideas.
- **Share** what I learn through clear, helpful code and documentation.

##  What’s Next

| Action | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Start a public repo | Showcase your skills & progress |
| Create a README for each project | Help others understand your work |
| Contribute to open-source | Collaborate and learn from others |
